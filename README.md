# Multi-Volume NetApp Scheduled Backups with Google Cloud Functions

This repository contains a Google Cloud Function that automates the creation and management of NetApp volume backups for multiple volumes using a CSV file. The function reads a CSV file that lists volumes and their corresponding backup vaults to schedule backups on a preconfigured routine. Each backup is labeled for easy identification, and if the number of backups for any volume exceeds the configured limit (default is 24), the oldest backup is deleted before creating a new one. The function is triggered by Cloud Scheduler through a Pub/Sub topic, ensuring backups are created on a regular schedule.

## How It Works

### Architecture Diagram

Below is the architecture diagram that illustrates how the components interact:

**Architecture Diagram**

### Terraform Deployment

Resources, including storage pools, volumes, backup vaults, and API configurations, are deployed using Terraform.

### Scheduled Trigger

Cloud Scheduler triggers the Cloud Function via a Pub/Sub topic according to a defined cron schedule.

### Cloud Function Operation

- The Cloud Function reads a CSV file containing a list of volumes and their associated backup vaults.
- For each entry in the CSV, the function uses the NetApp API to create a backup.
- Each backup is labeled for identification.
- If backups exceed the retention limit (default is 24), the oldest backup is deleted before a new one is created.

## Prerequisites

### APIs

The following APIs need to be enabled in your Google Cloud project:

- Cloud Functions API
- Cloud Build API
- Pub/Sub API
- NetApp API
- Cloud Scheduler API

The `apis.tf` file automatically enables the APIs needed through Terraform.

### Permissions

The user needs to have the Google Cloud NetApp Volumes **"NetApp Admin"** role to use this script successfully.

If deploying through Terraform, the Terraform service account needs this role. The `iam.tf` file automatically grants the service account this role through Terraform.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oreade97/Netapp-Scheduled-Backups.git
```

### 2. Configure Terraform Variables

Navigate to the Terraform Files folder.  
Create a `.tfvars` file to store the following variables:

| Variable                | Description                                             |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `project_id`            | The Google Cloud project ID                             |
| `region`                | The region where NetApp resources exist and the function will be deployed |
| `service_account_key_file` | The file containing your service account keys      |
| `backup_schedule`       | Frequency and time of backup in cron format             |

> **Important**: For the multi-volume backup functionality, the volume name and backup vault name are now determined by the CSV file, so the variables `volume_name` and `backup_vault_name` are not used.

Open the `backup.tf` file and update the `location` variable to match the region where your volumes are located.

### 3. Configure the Backup Function

Navigate to the Backup Function folder.  
Edit the `main.py` file (or your preferred configuration file) to set the following variables:

| Variable           | Description                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `BACKUP_LABEL_KEY` | Label key for the scheduled backups         |
| `BACKUP_LABEL_VALUE` | Label value for the scheduled backups     |
| `MAX_BACKUPS`      | Total number of backups to keep             |

#### CSV File Configuration

Add a CSV file (e.g., `volumes.csv`) to the Cloud Function package.  
The CSV should list the volumes and their corresponding backup vaults in the following format:

```
volume_name,backup_vault_name
volume1,vaultA
volume2,vaultB
...
```

This file allows the Cloud Function to determine which volumes to back up and the corresponding backup vault for each.

Once all modifications are made, compress the contents of the Backup Function folder into a ZIP archive. Name this archive `backup.zip` (or use the name specified in your Terraform configuration under `cloudfunction.tf`).

### 4. Deploy with Terraform

Initialize Terraform in the directory with your Terraform files:

```bash
terraform init
```

Run a Terraform plan to preview the resources to be created:

```bash
terraform plan
```

Apply the plan to deploy the resources:

```bash
terraform apply
```

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, please open an issue or submit a pull request in this repository.

## Summary

This solution leverages a CSV file to enable automated multi-volume backups for NetApp. The Cloud Function reads the CSV, creates backups for each listed volume, and enforces a retention policy by deleting the oldest backups when the maximum number is exceeded.

**Happy backing up! ðŸ˜Š**
